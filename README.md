## Project Name: SLE Interactive Learning

### Introduction

SLE Interactive Learning is an innovative app designed to make sign language learning accessible and enjoyable. This app stands out with its use of cutting-edge 3D models and artificial intelligence, providing an interactive learning experience. Whether youâ€™re learning at your own pace or challenging yourself with a time-bound quiz, SLE Interactive Learning caters to various learning preferences.

### Prerequisites

To get started with SLE Interactive Learning, ensure you have the following:

- macOS with the latest updates.
- The latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which you can download from the Apple Developer website.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your machine:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the SLE Interactive Learning repository using the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/username/sle-interactive-learning.git

#### Step 2: Open the Project in Xcode

Change into the cloned directory:

cd sle-interactive-learning

Open the project workspace in Xcode:

open sle-interactive-learning.xcworkspace

#### Step 3: Run the App

In Xcode, select an iOS simulator or connect your iOS device and choose it as the build target. Press the "Run" button or the Cmd + R shortcut to build and run the app.

### Inspiration

Our motivation stems from personal experiences and the challenges faced by deaf friends. We're on a mission to create a comprehensive tool that makes learning sign language not only more accessible but also an enjoyable experience.

### Functionality

SLE Interactive Learning leverages state-of-the-art 3D models and AI to provide an engaging sign language learning experience. The app includes a self-paced learning mode and a quiz mode to accommodate different learning styles.

### Building Process

We utilized echoAR for the rendering of 3D models and integrated machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate sign verification, providing a seamless learning experience.

### Challenges

One significant challenge was finding appropriate 3D models for the sign language alphabet. This challenge led us to learn 3D modeling software to create the models ourselves.

### Achievements

Our most notable achievement is the fusion of 3D models with AI technology, resulting in a user-friendly sign language learning app that suits various learning styles.

### Lessons Learned

Through this project, we've acquired skills in 3D model rigging and posing, training CoreML models, and using the Apple Vision API for image recognition.

### Future Vision for SLE Learn

We aim to expand the app's vocabulary, include phrases, structured training modules, and introduce new learning modes like a speed-run feature. Our goal is to enhance the learning experience, making it more comprehensive and engaging for users.
